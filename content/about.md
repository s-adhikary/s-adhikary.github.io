I'm a PhD student at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where I do research in Computation on Encrypted Data (COED) with a focus on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Functional Encryption (FE).
I'm also interested in code-based cryptography.
My supervisor is [Angshuman Karmaker](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/angshuman/).

Before I joined IIT Kanpur, I studied at [Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) and received my M.Tech in Cryptology and Security. My academic foundation includes the acquisition of both B.Sc in Mathematics and M.Sc in Pure Mathematics degrees from the University of Calcutta.

My research focuses in exploring methods for performing computations on encrypted data, specifically delving into areas like Homomorphic encryption and Functional encryption. Additionally, I have a keen interest in post-quantum cryptographic techniques, including lattice-based cryptography and code-based cryptography.
